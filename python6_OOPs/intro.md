# What is _**Object Oriented Programming**_?

**Object Oriented** means directed towards objects. In other words, it means functionally directed towards modelling objects. This is one of the many techniques used for modelling complex systems by describing a collection of interacting objects via their data and behavior.

## Why to Choose Object Oriented Programming?

#### Python was designed with an object-oriented approach. OOP offers the following advantages −

1. Provides a clear program structure, which makes it easy to map real world problems and their solutions.

2. Facilitates easy maintenance and modification of existing code.

3. Enhances program modularity because each object exists independently and new features can be added easily without disturbing the existing ones.

4. Presents a good framework for code libraries where supplied components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer.

5. Imparts code reusability

## Principles of Object Oriented Programming.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on the concept of objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. In order for a programming language to be object-oriented, it should have a mechanism to enable working with classes and objects as well as the implementation and usage of the fundamental object-oriented principles and concepts namely inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism.

## Object-Oriented Python.

The heart of Python programming is object and OOP, however you need not restrict yourself to use the OOP by organizing your code into classes. OOP adds to the whole design philosophy of Python and encourages a clean and pragmatic way to programming. OOP also enables in writing bigger and complex programs.

### Modules vs. Classes and Objects:

**Modules are like “Dictionaries”**
When working on Modules, note the following points −

* A Python module is a package to encapsulate reusable code.

* Modules reside in a folder with a __init__.py file on it.

* Modules contain functions and classes.

* Modules are imported using the import keyword.

* Recall that a dictionary is a key-value pair. That means if you have a dictionary with a key EmployeID and you want to retrieve it, then you will have to use the following lines of code −


employee = {“EmployeID”: “Employee Unique Identity!”}

print (employee [‘EmployeID])
